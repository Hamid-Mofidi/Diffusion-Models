# Diffusion-Models
Diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models, are a class of latent variable models. They are Markov chains trained using variational inference. Diffusion models are a powerful tool for understanding complex data and generating new samples based on what they've learned. 

In computer vision, diffusion models can be used to "clean up" blurry images. By training a neural network to reverse the diffusion process, we can remove the Gaussian noise that causes images to look blurry.

They are called "generative" models because they are able to generate new data samples from the learned distribution. During training, the model learns how likely it is that certain data points will appear. Then, to create new data, the model applies the inverse of the diffusion process to a random noise sample.
